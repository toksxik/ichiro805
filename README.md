AI + Humans — Landing Page

This repository contains a simple static landing page that explains how AI can help humans solve problems, built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.

Files created:
- index.html — main page (Bootstrap CDN used)
- css/styles.css — small custom stylesheet
- js/main.js — simple interactions (smooth scroll, demo suggestion, subscribe form handling)

Additional pages:
- article.html — long-form article with TOC and reading progress
- about.html — project/about page
- directory.html — LLM directory page (now Tailwind dark theme, external links to providers)

UI framework:
- This site was migrated from Bootstrap to Tailwind (using the Tailwind CDN for a zero-build quick iteration). All main pages (`index.html`, `article.html`, `about.html`, `directory.html`) now use Tailwind utility classes.

How to run
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (no server required).
2. Optionally serve it with a simple static server if you prefer (e.g., VS Code Live Server).

Notes
- The subscribe form and quick demo are client-only placeholders for demonstration and do not send data.
- Images use placeholder services for visuals; replace with your assets for production.
